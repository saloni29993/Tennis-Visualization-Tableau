# TennisVizTableau
This repository is for a Visualization created in Tableau which shows statistics for tennis matches

We all know that the first serve percentage is the most common statistics mentioned while analyzing a tennis match. Also the commentators mention the percentage of first serve a player connects on. A very famous player Stan Smith once said “The receiver is in defensive mind-set on your first serve. By making a lot of first serves, you keep him on the defensive. If you miss a first serve, the receiver is going to be licking his chops.” However, I always wondered whether is first serve percentage the only deciding factor or is it an overrated statistics? 

I always felt that though it is psychologically important to maintain consistency on first serve, the player should not be under pressure at this point. Even if the player misses the first serve, he still has a second serve to give his opponent a chance to miss the shot and score an ace. Instead of being demoralized by not scoring the first serve, the player should concentrate on the other parts of the game like scoring of total points, returns, aces and less error. The visualization supports this thought process. It says that even if the player’s first serve percentage is less, he/she was a successful winner. Out of the 10 matches of men’s singles, we see four instances where the winner’s first serve percentage is less than the loser’s first serve percentage. Out of the 10 matches of women’s singles, we see four such instances and two instances where winner and loser both score same percentage of first serves.

The visualization uses obvious color pallet, red indicating a loser and blue indicating a winner. The label inside the bars shows the exact percentage of the first serves scored by a player making it very efficient to read. The player’s image on the left end of blue bar indicates the winner and on the end of red bar indicates the loser. The images of the player also makes it easy to recognize who won the match and against whom. The idea behind using the horizontal bidirectional bar was to show that the loser’s bar extends more towards the right as compared to the winner’s bar stretches toward left. This visually makes the right bar i.e the loser’s bar seem larger indicating more percentage than that of the winner.

The visualization is created using Tableau. You may download the workbook from the repo. Below is the screenshot of how visualization looks.
